Days 1-2: Variables and Data Types CURRENT
Practice with: let, const, and var (focusing on modern usage of let and const)

Resource: Complete the "JavaScript Variables" section on MDN Web Docs

Project: Create a small "personal dashboard" that stores and displays different data types (strings, numbers, booleans)

Notes:

- It's better to use let rather than var.
- don't remove the text content, need to hide it instead
